This code makes an API request to the website 'www.alphavantage.co' for global quote data regarding Amazon (symbol: AMZN). An https connection is initially created and the specific endpoint containing the necessary information is accessed using a GET request. If successful, a response object containing the data in JSON format is retrieved and read into memory as a string. This string then gets parsed into readable python objects using json loads(). The first if statement checks for a Global Quote key in order to verify that our response contains what we originally requested before extracting out certain fields of interest - symbol, price, and volume. Finally this data prints out unless an error or warning occurs due to unsuccessful communication or bad formatting.
